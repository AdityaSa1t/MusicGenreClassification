##### Description: By using Librosa, audio features were extracted from given music samples and based on this data, a softmax component was implemented using Keras to predict how much of a fit it is to a particular genre. This was essentially an experiment in multi-label classification, which is why the hamming loss was also used to determine how well the model performs. 

##### Please do take a look at the results in the jupyter notebook.
